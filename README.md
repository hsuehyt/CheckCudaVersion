# CUDA Version Checker

This repository contains a simple Python script to check the version of CUDA installed on your system using PyTorch.

## Description

The `CheckCudaVersion.py` script helps you quickly determine the version of CUDA that is currently installed on your machine. This can be useful for debugging and ensuring compatibility with various machine learning frameworks and libraries that rely on CUDA for GPU acceleration.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CUDA-Version-Checker.git
    cd CUDA-Version-Checker
    ```

2. **Install PyTorch**:
    Follow the installation instructions for PyTorch from the [official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

## Usage

1. **Run the script**:
    ```bash
    python CheckCudaVersion.py
    ```

2. **Output**:
    The script will print the current version of CUDA installed on your system.

    ```
    The current CUDA version installed is x.x
    ```
